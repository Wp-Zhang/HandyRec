## Description
**HandyRec** is a package of deep-learning recommendation models implemented with **TF2.1+**✨. It is meant to be an **easy-to-use** and **easy-to-read** package for people who want to use or learn deep-learning recommendation models.

I recently started to learn deep-learning recommendation algorithms💦 and will try to implement some classical algorithms along with example notebooks here.

## Models

### Match / Candidate Generation

| Model      | Paper | Example |
| :----------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| YouTubeDNN      | \[RecSys 2016\] [Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2959100.2959190) | [![Jupyer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter%20Notebook-grey?logo=jupyter)](https://github.com/Wp-Zhang/HandyRec/blob/master/handyrec/examples/match/YouTubeDNN.ipynb) |


## Usage

This project is under development and has not been packaged yet😣. Please download the source code and import it as a local module.

- [ ] 🚧 I'll package this project when >10 models are implemented.



## Acknowledgments

Especially thanks to [DeepMatch](https://github.com/shenweichen/DeepMatch) and [DeepCTR](https://github.com/shenweichen/DeepCTR). I got much inspiration about code structure and model implementation from these projects.
