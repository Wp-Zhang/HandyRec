## 📝 Description
**HandyRec** is a package of deep-learning recommendation models implemented with **TF2.1** ✨. It is meant to be an **easy-to-use** and **easy-to-read** package for people who want to use or learn deep-learning recommendation models.

I recently started to learn deep-learning recommendation algorithms💦 and will try to implement some classical algorithms along with example notebooks here.

## 🛎️ Acknowledgments

Especially thanks to [DeepMatch](https://github.com/shenweichen/DeepMatch) and [DeepCTR](https://github.com/shenweichen/DeepCTR). I got much inspiration about code structure and model implementation from these projects.
