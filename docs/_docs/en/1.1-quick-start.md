HandyRec is a package of deep-learning recommendation models implemented with **TF2.5** âœ¨. It is meant to be an **easy-to-use** and **easy-to-read** package for people who want to use or learn deep-learning recommendation models.

It is currently a personal project for learning purposes. I recently started to learn deep-learning recommendation algorithms and design patternsðŸ’¦. I'll try to implement some classical algorithms along with example notebooks here.

<!-- In this document, you will learn how to **install the theme**, **setup your site**, **local preview** for development, **build** and **publish**. -->

This project is under development and has not been packaged yetðŸ˜£. Please download the source code and import it as a local module.

The Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/Wp-Zhang/HandyRec/blob/master/examples/YouTubeDNN.ipynb) tested the model proposed in [Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2959100.2959190) on the common dataset **MovieLens1M**. The notebook can be directly opened in Google Colab, please try it out ðŸ˜ƒ!
