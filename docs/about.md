HandyRec is a package of deep-learning recommendation models implemented with TF2.5 ✨. It is meant to be an easy-to-use and easy-to-read package for people who want to use or learn deep-learning recommendation models.

It is currently a personal project for learning purposes. I recently started to learn deep-learning recommendation algorithms and design patterns💦. I'll try to implement some classical algorithms along with example notebooks here.
